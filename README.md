# My First React App!

## About

I created this app in the summer of 2019. This was my first React App and it used firebase for authentication and storage. The name of the app is __HomeSplit__. The purpose of this web application was to create a way for roomates to create accounts and groups. In these groups, they can enter costs in and the app would automatically split the cost among all roomates in the group. The app would then tell each roomate about who they owed money to whom, and who owed them money.
